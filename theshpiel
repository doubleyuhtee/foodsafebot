The United States Food and Drug administration doesn't actually have a definition for "Food Safe".  The classification is Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS). While [PLA](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1061), and many forms of [Polyethylene (PET)](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=177.1630) including [Polyethylene glycol (PETG)](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.820) have these classifications, they are for the raw materials, not pigments or additives that are used to make it "silky" or have other properties.

The classification for PLA was granted "with no limitation other than current good manufacturing practice", which at the time did not include 3d printing.  The method of deposition leaves pockets where bacteria can grow. Additionally, it is possible (though unlikely) that heavy metals can leach from the hot end into the plastics. Most resins are toxic in their liquid form and prolonged contact can deposit trace chemicals. For these reasons, it's recommended you use a food safe epoxy sealer.

Or don't. I'm a bot, not a cop.
